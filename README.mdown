IBAForms
============
IBAForms is a framework for building data entry screens on the iPhone. You can quickly make forms using the built-in form field types or create your own custom fields and the user interfaces used to enter data for them. It is an Objective-C library that provides an abstraction layer above common UIKit classes such as UITableView and UITableViewCell.

Features
============
IBAForms:

 *  Provides a set of common form field types (text, password, boolean, date, pick list). 
 *  Manages focus and navigation between form fields.
 *  Supports binding a form to its backing model via KVC.
 *  Supports transformation of form values via NSValueTransformer.
 *  Provides basic styling capabilities at the form, section and field level.
 *  Provides extension points for creating your own custom form fields.
